Cover Letter Generator Agent

This module provides functionality to generate personalized cover letters using LLM agents.
It combines resume data, GitHub profile information, and job requirements to create
compelling cover letters tailored to specific job applications.

Key Components:
- CoverLetterInput model for structured input data
- Template-based prompt construction for consistent formatting
- Integration with various LLM providers (Google Gemini, etc.)
- Flexible prompt building with fallback handling for missing data

Usage:
    The agent is designed to work within a LangGraph workflow, receiving parsed
    resume and GitHub data to generate personalized cover letters.

    Constructs a formatted prompt for cover letter generation.
    
    This function takes structured input data and formats it into a prompt template
    that provides all necessary context for the LLM to generate a personalized cover letter.
    
    Args:
        input (CoverLetterInput): Structured input containing job and applicant information
        github_info (str, optional): String representation of GitHub profile data. Defaults to "".

        All input fields are safely handled with fallback to empty strings to prevent
        template formatting errors when data is missing.
