It is a precarious balance to manage, as I learned in my prior production associate role.\n\nThe publishing industry is rapidly changing, with the evolution of e-books and other online learning content. You are likely seeking a production editor who can manage multiple projects at once, adapt quickly, and work within a variety of programs and data systems.

I am eager to bring my insight and my eye for detail to your team as a production editor. I have vivid memories of working on a project where I wrote about the history of bathtub creation during my time in college. I was forced to thoroughly research disciplines far outside of my comfort zone and problem-solve to deliver high-quality writing.\n\nA colleague in the industry has shared more insight with me about how your team deeply cares about its members. I'm really excited about the potential of joining your production-editorial team.\n\nPlease let me know how I can further illustrate my candidacy for the production editor role.
